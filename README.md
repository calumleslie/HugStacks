HugStacks
=========

HugStacks is a simple [stack-oriented][stacklang], [concatenative][catlang] language.

This is mostly a toy project; it was written it to put scripting capability into an IRC bot
(project HugIrc). If you are looking for this type of language to do anything serious try
[Factor][factor], which is sophisticated, modern, and well-implemented. This system is none
of those things.
